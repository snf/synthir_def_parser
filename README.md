# synthir_def_parser

Definition parser for CPU arch description used in Synthir experiment
that gets the file (check the one in defs/) and writes a trait
implementation in Rust.

## Full Disclosure

This parser is mostly an experiment I made testing FParsec when all
the project was gonna be written in F# but finally built it with Rust.
